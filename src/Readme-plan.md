## Arrays and sorting
- Example task mid-difficulty: 
-- Maximum sum path on a 2d grid: GO tthro
-- Maximum sum of 3 non-overlapping arrays
-- Maximum sum of 2 non-overlapping subarrays
x-- The Coin Change Problem: This problem involves dynamic programming and arrays. It's not directly related to sorting, but understanding how to manipulate arrays is crucial for the solution.  
-- Matrix Layer Rotation: This problem involves rotating elements in a 2D array. It's not a sorting problem, but it does require understanding how to manipulate arrays.  
x-- Minimum Swaps 2: This problem involves sorting an array by swapping elements. It's a direct application of sorting and array manipulation.  
x-- Arrays: Left Rotation: This problem involves rotating elements in an array. It's not a sorting problem, but it does require understanding how to manipulate arrays.  
-- New Year Chaos: This problem involves sorting and arrays. It requires understanding the concept of "bribes" as swaps in a queue, which can be represented as an array.


## Array manipulation


## Arrays and Heaps related question.
- Example task mid-difficulty:

- Easy String manipulation question
  You are given 2 arrays: one representing the time people arrive at a door and other representing the direction they want to go(in or out)
  You have to find at what time each person will use the door provided no 2 people can use the door at the same time.

2nd round coding challenge (max heap question),

Very easy , arrays and Heaps related question.
Time complexity of it
