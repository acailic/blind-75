### ChatGPT

Sure, here are some interview questions that are commonly used in platforms like HackerRank, and are typically expected to be solvable in less than 30 minutes:
Array Manipulation: Given a list of queries to manipulate an array, like adding a value to elements within a certain range or finding the maximum value after all operations.
String Manipulation: Tasks like checking if a string is a palindrome, finding the longest common substring, or implementing string compression algorithms.
Sorting and Searching: Implementing sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, or solving problems related to searching in sorted arrays efficiently.
Graph Algorithms: Problems like finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), or checking if a graph is bipartite.
Dynamic Programming: Solving problems like the 0-1 knapsack problem, or finding the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
Tree Algorithms: Tasks such as finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree or checking if a binary tree is balanced.
Greedy Algorithms: Problems like finding the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount or scheduling tasks to minimize completion time.
Backtracking: Tasks like solving Sudoku puzzles or generating all possible permutations of a given set of elements.
Bit Manipulation: Problems like finding the number of set bits in an integer or checking if a number is a power of two.
Mathematical Problems: Tasks involving number theory, like finding prime numbers or implementing algorithms to calculate factorial or Fibonacci numbers.
